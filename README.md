| Stage                    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Checkout / Setup**     | Fetches your repo and installs Python 3.11 plus runtime dependencies (`requests`, `adaptsapi`).                                                                                                                |
| **Author e-mail lookup** | Uses GitHub’s GraphQL API to obtain the PR author’s **organisation-verified e-mail** (Enterprise Cloud feature). Falls back to the head-commit author e-mail if needed.                                       |
| **Repo intel**           | Calculates repository size in bytes (for metadata) and determines dominant language.                                                                                                                           |
| **Adapts API call**      | Sends a signed request to Adapts’ `/generate_wiki_docs` endpoint so the service can pull the code and build Wiki pages.                                                                                        |

## ⚡ Quick-start

1. **Signup for Adapts: Code to Wiki**  
   Signup at [`adapts.app`](https://adapts.app) with your github email address. 

2. **Copy the workflow file**  
   Save [`.github/workflows/action.yml`](./action.yml) into your own repo under the same path.

3. **Add required secrets**  
   Go to *Settings ▸ Secrets and variables ▸ Actions* and add:

   | Secret                  | Where to get it                              |
   | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
   | `ADAPTS_API_KEY`        | Request from <contact@adapts.ai>             |
   | `ENTERPRISE_READ_TOKEN` | Fine-grained PAT (org admin) **or** GitHub App installation token |

   <details>
   <summary><strong>SSO note</strong></summary>
   If your org enforces SAML/OIDC SSO, remember to **authorise** the PAT after creating it.
   </details>

   For detailed instructions on adding secrets, see the [official GitHub documentation on using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

4. **Verify domain settings**  
   Ensure your org has **verified its corporate e-mail domain** and each developer has added that address to GitHub.

5. **Push or merge a PR**  
   Merge into `main` and watch for a ✅ Success log entry:

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

| Name                       | Source                         | Purpose                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `GH_TOKEN`                 | `ENTERPRISE_READ_TOKEN` secret | Used by `gh` CLI for GraphQL calls               |
| `ADAPTS_API_KEY`           | Secret                         | Bearer token for Adapts AI API                   |
| GitHub defaults (`GITHUB_…`)| Provided by Actions            | Context for repo, actor, etc.                    |

---

## 🛠️ Customisation Tips

- **Target branch**: edit `on.pull_request.branches`.  
- **Monorepos**: document sub-directories by filtering or passing extra metadata.  
- **Non-Enterprise orgs**: remove GraphQL step and rely on commit e-mails.  
- **Self-hosted runners**: install the GitHub CLI or add an explicit install step.

| Author e-mail is `noreply@users.github.com`                       | Developer hasn’t added corporate e-mail   | Ask them to add it via GitHub Profile ▸ Emails                                       |

## 🔐 Security considerations

- Tokens are **read-only** and never leave GitHub infra.  
- Only **metadata** (URL, size, language) is sent to Adapts AI.  
- Source code is fetched by Adapts AI via the provided GitHub token.

---

## 🌐 Accessing your Wiki

1. Visit [adapts.app](https://adapts.app)  
2. **Log in** with the **same e-mail** you use on GitHub  
3. Navigate to **Application Wiki's** ➡️ **Your Repo Name**  ➡️ **Click on View**  
4. Enjoy your freshly generated Wiki!
